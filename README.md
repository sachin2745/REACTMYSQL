I created a small project using React for the front-end, with MySQL as the backend. The project includes a data table that supports pagination, searching, sorting, and downloading functionality. It fetches user data from a MySQL table and allows updating properties such as popular status, sort-by criteria, and active/inactive status. The table also supports full CRUD operations, enabling easy management of user data.
